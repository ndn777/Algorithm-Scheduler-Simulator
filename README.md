# Algorithm-Scheduler-Simulator
Use any IDE or website that can run a java program.

Import all 8 java files:

  AlgScheduler.java (contains the main method)
  
  Process.java
  
  ProcessQueue.java
  
  ProcessFinder.java
  
  Report.java
  
  FCFSRR.java
  
  SRT.java
  
  HRRN.java
  
Compile and run to start the program.

Program will display a prompt to choose an algorithm.

Choose 1 for First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), 2 for Round-Robin (RR), 3 for Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT), or 4 for Highest-Response-Rate-Next (HRRN)

Type a number and press enter to simulate the algorithm.

The program will display when a new process is created and also a statistical report when a process finishes. Additionally, there will be another summary report that will output every minute.

Users will need to manually stop the program since it will run indefinitely.
